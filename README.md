Collagen and Muscle Area Analysis Macro for FIJI (ImageJ)

This FIJI (ImageJ) macro is designed to analyze collagen and muscle area in samples that have been stained using the Masson's Trichome Stain.
After staining the images should be pre-processed using simple segmentation in Ilastik.

FEATURES
- Quantify collagen, muscle and background areas in TIF images pre-processed with Ilastik segmentation.
- Identify and analyze collagen regions of interest (ROI) patches within the image.
- Results are presented through pop-up dialog boxes for quick visual assessment.

HOW TO USE
1. Ensure you have FIJI (imageJ) installed on your system.
2. Import TIF images that have undergone simple segmentation in Ilastik.
3. Run the macro.
4. The first pop-up dialog will display the area distribution of label (background, collagen, muscle) found in the image. Click "OK" to proceed.
5. The second pop-up dialog will present the results of collagen ROI patches found in the image.
6. Review the results to obtain insights into collagen and muscle areas and their spatial distribution.

REQUIREMENTS
